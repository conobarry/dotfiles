# dotfiles

These are my personal configuration files for my linux machines.

Each computer I own has its own dotfiles, with some overlap between them. Currently I am separating them via different branches of this repository.

You are welcome to take a look at my configs and copy or use whatever you like.

## main branch

Dotfiles used on my desktop computer "apollo".

## neptune branch

Dotfiles used on my laptop "neptune".
